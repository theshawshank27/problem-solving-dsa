Let's design a parking lot system with a detailed low-level design (LLD). This design will cover various aspects such as multiple floors, entry and exit points, different types of parking spots, and payment processing.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is this a multiple floor parking garage or a single level parking lot?
2. How many entry and exit points will be needed, and for what types of vehicles?
3. Are there monetary goals for this parking lot?

### High-Level Design

#### Use Cases

1. **Customers**: Parking and paying for their spot.
2. **Admin**: Managing the system.
3. **Parking Attendants**: Maintaining the lot and helping customers.

#### Possible Classes

1. **ParkingLot**: Manages the overall parking lot.
2. **ParkingFloor**: Represents each floor in the parking lot.
3. **ParkingSpot**: Represents individual parking spots.
4. **Vehicle**: Represents different types of vehicles.
5. **ParkingTicket**: Represents the parking ticket issued to customers.
6. **PaymentProcessor**: Handles payment processing.

### Detailed Low-Level Design

#### ParkingLot Class

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class ParkingLot {
    private List<ParkingFloor> floors;
    private List<EntryPoint> entryPoints;
    private List<ExitPoint> exitPoints;

    public ParkingLot() {
        floors = new ArrayList<>();
        entryPoints = new ArrayList<>();
        exitPoints = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addFloor(ParkingFloor floor) {
        floors.add(floor);
    }

    public void addEntryPoint(EntryPoint entryPoint) {
        entryPoints.add(entryPoint);
    }

    public void addExitPoint(ExitPoint exitPoint) {
        exitPoints.add(exitPoint);
    }

    public ParkingSpot findAvailableSpot(Vehicle vehicle) {
        for (ParkingFloor floor : floors) {
            ParkingSpot spot = floor.getAvailableSpot(vehicle);
            if (spot != null) {
                return spot;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

#### ParkingFloor Class

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class ParkingFloor {
    private int floorNumber;
    private List<ParkingSpot> spots;

    public ParkingFloor(int floorNumber) {
        this.floorNumber = floorNumber;
        spots = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addSpot(ParkingSpot spot) {
        spots.add(spot);
    }

    public ParkingSpot getAvailableSpot(Vehicle vehicle) {
        for (ParkingSpot spot : spots) {
            if (spot.isAvailable() && vehicle.canFitInSpot(spot.getType())) {
                return spot;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

#### ParkingSpot Class

```java
public class ParkingSpot {
    private String id;
    private ParkingSpotType type;
    private boolean available;

    public ParkingSpot(String id, ParkingSpotType type) {
        this.id = id;
        this.type = type;
        this.available = true;
    }

    public boolean isAvailable() {
        return available;
    }

    public void parkVehicle() {
        available = false;
    }

    public void removeVehicle() {
        available = true;
    }

    public ParkingSpotType getType() {
        return type;
    }
}
```

#### Vehicle Class

```java
public class Vehicle {
    private String licensePlate;
    private VehicleType type;

    public Vehicle(String licensePlate, VehicleType type) {
        this.licensePlate = licensePlate;
        this.type = type;
    }

    public boolean canFitInSpot(ParkingSpotType spotType) {
        switch (type) {
            case CAR:
                return spotType == ParkingSpotType.COMPACT || spotType == ParkingSpotType.LARGE;
            case TRUCK:
                return spotType == ParkingSpotType.LARGE;
            case MOTORBIKE:
                return spotType == ParkingSpotType.MOTORBIKE;
            case ELECTRIC:
                return spotType == ParkingSpotType.ELECTRIC || spotType == ParkingSpotType.COMPACT || spotType == ParkingSpotType.LARGE;
            default:
                return false;
        }
    }
}
```

#### ParkingTicket Class

```java
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public class ParkingTicket {
    private String ticketId;
    private Vehicle vehicle;
    private LocalDateTime entryTime;
    private LocalDateTime exitTime;

    public ParkingTicket(String ticketId, Vehicle vehicle) {
        this.ticketId = ticketId;
        this.vehicle = vehicle;
        this.entryTime = LocalDateTime.now();
    }

    public void setExitTime() {
        this.exitTime = LocalDateTime.now();
    }

    public String getTicketId() {
        return ticketId;
    }

    public Vehicle getVehicle() {
        return vehicle;
    }

    public LocalDateTime getEntryTime() {
        return entryTime;
    }

    public LocalDateTime getExitTime() {
        return exitTime;
    }
}
```

#### PaymentProcessor Class

```java
public class PaymentProcessor {
    public void processPayment(ParkingTicket ticket) {
        // Logic to process payment based on ticket details
        System.out.println("Payment processed for ticket " + ticket.getTicketId());
    }
}
```

### Example Usage

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ParkingLot parkingLot = new ParkingLot();
        ParkingFloor floor1 = new ParkingFloor(1);
        ParkingSpot spot1 = new ParkingSpot("1A", ParkingSpotType.COMPACT);
        ParkingSpot spot2 = new ParkingSpot("1B", ParkingSpotType.LARGE);
        floor1.addSpot(spot1);
        floor1.addSpot(spot2);
        parkingLot.addFloor(floor1);

        Vehicle car = new Vehicle("ABC123", VehicleType.CAR);
        ParkingSpot availableSpot = parkingLot.findAvailableSpot(car);
        if (availableSpot != null) {
            availableSpot.parkVehicle();
            ParkingTicket ticket = new ParkingTicket("T123", car);
            PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor();
            paymentProcessor.processPayment(ticket);
            availableSpot.removeVehicle();
        } else {
            System.out.println("No available spot for the vehicle.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Edge Cases and Solutions

1. **Full Parking Lot**: Implement logic to show a message at the entrance panel and on the parking display board when the parking lot is full.
2. **Different Vehicle Sizes**: Ensure the system can handle different types of vehicles and parking spots.
3. **Payment Failures**: Handle payment failures and retries.
4. **Real-Time Updates**: Ensure real-time updates for parking spot availability and payment processing.
5. **Scalability**: Use distributed databases and caching mechanisms to handle high traffic and large volumes of data.

This design covers the basic functionality of a parking lot system, including user management, parking spot allocation, payment processing, and real-time tracking. You can expand this design by adding features like automated entry and exit points, parking spot reservations, and more. If you have any specific questions or need further details, feel free to ask!
